        Startup products are delicate. Without a developer who understands both{' '}
        <span className='bold'>technology</span> and{' '}
        <span className='bold'>business</span>, even strong ideas can fail due
        to poor execution.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m a <span className='bold'>frontend developer</span> and
        product-minded partner who helps startups and growing businesses turn
        ideas into scalable, high-performing websites and mobile applications.
        When an idea is built right, it feels like the exact solution users have
        been searching for, and that’s where real conversions happen.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have 4+ years of experience helping founders move from “just an idea”
        to <span className='bold'>websites</span> and{' '}
        <span className='bold'>mobile applications</span> that attract users,
        convert effectively, and scale with confidence. If you have an idea you
        want to grow, let’s talk. I’m happy to learn about your goals, timeline,
        budget, and what <span className='bold'>success</span> looks like for
        your business
      </p>
      <p>
        In my spare time, I’m usually watching series, playing games with
        friends and trying new food.
